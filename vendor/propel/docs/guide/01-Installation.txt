= Installing Propel =

[[PageOutline]]

Propel is available as a [http://pear.php.net/manual/en/installation.getting.php PEAR] package, as a checkout from a Subversion repository, and as a "traditional" tgz or zip package. Whatever installation method you may choose, getting Propel to work is pretty straightforward.

== Prerequisites ==

Propel runs on most PHP platforms. It just requires:

 * [http://www.php.net/ PHP 5.2.4] or newer, with the DOM (libxml2) module enabled
 * A supported database (MySQL, MS SQL Server, PostgreSQL, SQLite, Oracle)
 
'''Tip''': Propel uses the PDO and SPL components, which are bundled and enabled by default in PHP5.

== Project-Local Installation ==

For a quick start, the best choice is to install Propel inside a project directory structure, typically under a `vendor/` subdirectory:

{{{
myproject/
  ...
  vendor/ <= This is where third-party libraries usually go
}}}

To install Propel there using Subversion, type:

{{{
#!sh
> cd myproject/vendor
> svn checkout http://svn.propelorm.org/branches/1.6 propel
}}}

This will export the propel library to a local `myproject/vendor/propel/` directory.

'''Tip''': Don't use the `trunk` from the Propel SVN repository. `branches/1.6` is the most up to date version.

Alternatively, to use a tarball, type the following commands on *nix platforms:

{{{
#!sh
> cd myproject/vendor
> wget http://files.propelorm.org/propel-1.6.0.tar.gz
> tar zxvf propel-1.6.0.tar.gz
> mv propel-1.6.0 propel
}}}

Or, in Windows, download a ZIP from http://files.propelorm.org, unzip it under the `vendor/` directory, and rename it to `propel`.

== Propel Directory Structure ==

The root directory of the Propel library includes the following folders:

||`generator`||Contains the classes required to run Propel in the command line. Propel commands can build the object model, compile configuration files, execute migrations, etc.||
||`runtime`  ||Contains the classes required to access Propel models and the database. Typically, applications using a web server will only access the `runtime` directory and not the `generator`.||
||`docs`     ||Complete documentation: guide, cookbook, reference, API. Don't hesitate to browse it - that's how you will learn Propel.||
||`tests`    ||Propel unit tests. Ignore this if you don't want to contribute to Propel.||

Usually, both the generator and the runtime components are installed on development environments, while the actual test or production servers may need only the runtime component installed.

== Installing Dependencies ==

The Propel generator uses [http://phing.info/ Phing 2.4.5] to manage command line tasks; both the generator and the runtime classes use [http://pear.php.net/package/Log/ PEAR Log] to log events.

To install these packages, use the PEAR command as follows:

{{{
#!sh
> pear channel-discover pear.phing.info
> pear install phing/phing
> pear install Log
}}}

Refer to their respective websites for alternative installation strategies for Phing and PEAR Log.

== Testing Propel Installation ==

The Propel generator component bundles a `propel-gen` sh script (and a `propel-gen.bat` script for Windows). This script makes it easy to execute build commands. You can test this component is properly installed by calling the `propel-gen` script from the CLI:

{{{
#!sh
> cd myproject
> vendor/propel/generator/bin/propel-gen
}}}

The script should output a welcome message, followed by a 'BUILD FAILED' message, which is normal - you haven't defined a model to build yet.

'''Tip''': In order to allow an easier execution the script, you can also add the propel generator's `bin/` directory to your PATH, or create a symlink. For example:

{{{
#!sh
> cd myproject
> ln -s vendor/propel/generator/bin/propel-gen propel-gen
}}}

At this point, Propel should be setup and ready to use. You can follow the steps in the [wiki:Documentation/1.6/BuildTime Build Guide] to try it out.

== Alternative: Global Installation Using PEAR ==

Alternatively, you can install Propel globally on your system using PEAR. All your projects will use the same Propel version - that may or may not be a good idea, depending on how often you update your projects.

Propel has its own PEAR channel, that you must "discover". Using the `pear install -a` command, you can let PEAR download and install all dependencies (Phing and PEAR Log).

So the commands to install Propel, Phing and PEAR Log globally sum up to this:

{{{
#!sh
> pear channel-discover pear.propelorm.org
> pear install -a propel/propel_generator
> pear install -a propel/propel_runtime
}}}

Once Propel is installed globally, you can access the `propel-gen` command from everywhere without symlink.

'''Tip''': If you want to install non-stable versions of Propel, change your `preferred_state` PEAR environment variable before installing the Propel packages. Valid states include 'stable', 'beta', 'alpha', and 'devel':

{{{
#!sh
> pear config-set preferred_state beta
}}}

== Troubleshooting ==

=== PHP Configuration ===

Propel requires the following settings in `php.ini`:

||'''Variable'''||'''Value'''||
||ze1_compatibility_mode||Off||
||magic_quotes_gpc||Off||
||magic_quotes_sybase||Off||

=== PEAR Directory In Include Path ===

If you choose to install Propel via PEAR, and if it's your first use of PEAR, the PEAR directory may not be on your PHP `include_path`. Check the [http://pear.php.net/manual/en/installation.checking.php PEAR documentation] for details on how to do that.

=== Phing Version ===

Phing versions 2.4.3 and 2.4.4 are incompatible with Propel. Check your Phing version by calling:

{{{
#!sh
> phing -v
}}}

In case you're using a version less than 2.4.5, upgrade to the latest stable version:

{{{
#!sh
> pear upgrade phing/phing
}}}

=== Getting Help ===

If you can't manage to install Propel, don't hesitate to ask for help. See [wiki:Support] for details on getting help.
